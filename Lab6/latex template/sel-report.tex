{The Entry/Exit of the parking lot is a single lane passage. By controlling the indicators, the program ensures that only one car can pass through the Entry/Exit so as to prevent a car accident between entering and leaving cars.}\\

\subsection{Requirement Descriptions}
%% R Description
\begin{tabular}{ | p{2cm} | p{6cm}  | p{6cm} |}
\hline
REQ1 & The controller will allow only one car within the passage at a time. & By monitoring sensors the system will ensure both gates will not be open at the same time. \\

%% R Description
\begin{tabular}{ | p{2cm} | p{6cm}  | p{6cm} |}
\hline
REQ2 & A car wishing to park will have priority over the cars which want to leave.   & If both sensors are on, the entering gate will open. \\

\subsection{Environment Descriptions}
%% E Description
\begin{tabular}{ | p{2cm} | p{6cm}  | p{6cm} |}
\hline
ENV1 & The sensors can only ever read ON or OFF.  & Only 2 states for each sensor. \\

%% E Description
\begin{tabular}{ | p{2cm} | p{6cm}  | p{6cm} |}
\hline
ENV2 & The actuators can only ever be GO or STOP.  & Can only ever indicate either 2 states. \\

\section{List of Variables}

\subsection{Controlled Variables}

{Each of the controlled variables represents an ACTUATOR which has two states; either STOP or GO.\\} 

\begin{tabular}{ | p{2cm} | p{12cm}  |}
\hline
Name & Description  \\
\hline
X1 & Car entering sensor. ON when a car passes through the sense.    \\
\hline
X2 & Car leaving sensor. ON when a car passes through the sense.    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\\
\\

\subsection{Monitored Variables}
{Each of the monitored variables represents an SENSOR which has two states; either ON or OFF.\\}\\

\begin{tabular}{ | p{2cm} | p{12cm}  |}
\hline
Name & Description  \\
\hline
Y1 & Car entering indicator, indicates GO when a car would like to enter.    \\
\hline
Y2 & Car leaving indicator, indicates GO when a car would like to leave.    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

% Function Table
\newpage
\section{Car Function Table}
{The function table presents a variable 'i' in DTIME which captures the value of both, the sensors and actuators, at each DTIME step.}
