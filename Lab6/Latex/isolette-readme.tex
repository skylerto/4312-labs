As stated in the course outline, you are required to read parts of  the Handbook \cite{REMH}  each week. In this assignment you will be constructing the function table for the Isolette described in \cite{REMH} (Appendix A). 

The Handbook omits E/R-descriptions and function  tables. Hence, the main learning outcomes for this Assignment is to complete a precise requirements document for the Isolette by providing the E/R-descriptions and function tables. You must check the function tables with PVS for completeness, disjointness and safety.

\textbf{What you must do}:

\begin{mylist}
\item Read this document and the  specification of the Isolette (in Appendix A of \cite{REMH}). We will be using only part of this Isolette requirements document \cite{REMH}. Also, there are some problems in \cite{REMH} which your are required to fix in your submission.
\item Provide a precise requirements document for the Isolette by completing the LaTeX template (isolette-assign.tex) in the SVN (LaTex files provided).
\item Complete the parts in the template \hl{highlighted in yellow}. By completing the provided template you will see the overall structure of a precise requirements documents. The final document you produce is \texttt{isolette-assign.pdf}.
\item Before the due date, submit an electronic copy of \texttt{isolette-assign.pdf} and place a printed copy of the PDF in the drop box.
\item You must also submit your PVS files and proofs in a folder \texttt{pvs}: submit 4312 assign isolette
