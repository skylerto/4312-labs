\section{System Overview}

The System Under Development (SUD) is a computer controller for the thermostat of an Isolette.\footnote{%
The image in Fig~\ref{fig:isolette} is from: \url{www.nufer-medical.ch}.}
An Isolette is an incubator for for an infant that provides controlled temperature, humidity and oxygen (Fig.~\ref{fig:isolette}). Isolettes are used extensively in Neonatal Intensive Care Units for the care of premature infants.

This requirements document is specifically for the control of temperature. The purpose of the Isolette computer controller is to maintain the air temperature of an Isolette within a desired range. It senses the current temperature of the Isolette and turns the heat source on and off to warm the air as needed. If the temperature falls too far below or rises too far above the desired temperature range, it activates an alarm to alert the nurse. The system allows the nurse to set the desired temperature range and to set the alarm temperature range outside the desired temperature range of which the alarm should be activated. This requirements documents follows the specification in \cite{REMH} (Appendix A) except where noted.

\section{Context Diagram}
 
See Fig. A-1 in \cite{REMH}. The System Under Description (SUD) is a computer \emph{controller} to regulate the temperature of the Isolette. Everything else including the Operator Interface (described in \cite{REMH}) is in the ecosystem (i.e. in the environment of the controller). The monitored variables and controlled variables for the controller are in Table~\ref{table:monitored} and 
Table~\ref{tbl:cv}, respectively. For clarity, simplicity and safety, there are some differences between the specifications in this document and the descriptions in \cite{REMH}.\footnote{%
Documented in the write-up to this assignment: \texttt{assign1-spec.pdf}.}

\section{Goals}

The high-level goals (G) of the system are:

\begin{mylist}
\item G1---The Infant should be kept at a safe and comfortable temperature.

\item G2---The Nurse should be warned if the Infant becomes too hot or too cold.

\item G3---The cost of manufacturing the computer controller for the thermostat should be as low as possible.
\end{mylist}

\section{Monitored Variables}

\hl{Ensure that the tables are completed.}

The monitored variables are a subset of those described in \cite{REMH}.\footnote{With some change of nomenclature. Monitored variables have an ``m'' prefix.} There is a single status variable \mv{st} that is \emph{invalid} whenever any one of the operator inputs or temperature sensor are in a failed state. Otherwise types and ranges are as in \cite{REMH}.
